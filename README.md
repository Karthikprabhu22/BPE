# BPE

Bayesian Parameter Estimation package for calculation of cosmological parameters and Hubble's constant

## Description

Given a dataset $\mathbf{\mu}$ as a function of redshift $z$, this package calculates, and samples from, the maximum 
likelihood set of CMB parameters, $P(\mathbf{\theta}})$.

This approach has been used in these papers:

1. Observational Evidence from Supernovae for an Accelerating Universe and a Cosmological Constant (https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9805201.pdf)
